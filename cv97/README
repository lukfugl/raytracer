Steps to use this package:

1. Copy tarball into your source directory and untar. This will create the
subdirectory cv97/ in your source directory (where this file is located).

2. Build the library. The makefile is set up to compile all the .o object files
then package them into the static package libcv97.a. The rest of this README
assumes that is what you have done. If you need to build it into some other
sort of library you're on your own.

3. When linking (assumed in your source directory), add '-Lcv97 -lcv97' to the
gcc statement. Eg:

g++ -o myProgram myProgram.cc -Lcv97 -lcv97

4. If I also include '-Icv97' in the above gcc statement, I can ignore the
directory prefix when including SceneGraph.h (or any other necessary .h files
from cv97/) in myProgram.cc. This is what I do. The corresponding gcc
statement:

g++ -o myProgram myProgram.cc -Icv97 -Lcv97 -lcv97

5. Enjoy.
